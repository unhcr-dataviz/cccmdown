The goal of `{cccmdown}` is to ease and speed up the creation of reports
following the [CCCM brand
identity](https://www.cccmcluster.org/branding-collection).

## Installation

Get started by installing the `{cccmdown}` package from GitHub using the
`{pak}` library:

``` r
# If pak is not yet installed, uncomment the following line:
# install.packages("pak")

pak::pkg_install("unhcr-dataviz/cccmdown")
```

## Usage

The `{cccmdown::paged_report}` template is designed for R Markdown
projects, simply put the following code in your R Markdown header. For
example:

``` yaml
---
title: "CCCM report"
date: "12 November 2023"
output:
  cccmdown::paged_report:
    coord_mec: "cluster"
    country: "Country name"
---
```

You can also open a `{cccmdown::paged_report}` template using
**RStudio**:

1.  Click the “File” menu then “New File” and choose “R Markdown”.
2.  In the “From Template” tab, choose the **CCCM Paged** built-in
    template.

Note that you will need to serve the output using a web server if using
`self_contained: false` due to [browser security
policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#file_origins).
The easiest way to do that during local development is to call
`servr::httd()` on the output directory.
